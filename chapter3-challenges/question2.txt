This informal introduction leaves a lot unspecified. 
List several open questions you have about the languageâ€™s syntax and semantics. 
What do you think the answers should be?

Answer: Some questions I have about the syntax is the print statement and how it handles different data types.
How does it know what is in the print statement and how to concatentate two diff data types. 
In python you use type casting to print diff data types, so I would assume Lox does the same.
Also, there is no explanation of how lists and arrays are handled. Do you just use Classes for them?
