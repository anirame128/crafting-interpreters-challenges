Aside from separating tokens—distinguishing print foo from printfoo—spaces aren’t used for much in most languages. 
However, in a couple of dark corners, a space does affect how code is parsed in CoffeeScript, Ruby, and the C preprocessor. 
Where and what effect does it have in each of those languages?

Answer: 
In CoffeeScript with a space means you are making a function call versus without a space where you are accessing elements
ex: f [1, 2, 3] vs. f[1, 2, 3]
