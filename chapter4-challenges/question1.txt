The lexical grammars of Python and Haskell are not regular. What does that mean, and why arenâ€™t they?

Answer: These grammars are not regular meaning they cannot be recognized by a finite state automaton.
This is because both languages are indentation based and to keep track of these indentations, you would need a stack,
which is beyond the scope of a finite automaton.
